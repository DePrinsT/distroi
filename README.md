# DISTROI

DISTROI, or **D**isk **I**nner **ST**ructure **R**econnaisance through **O**ptical **I**nteferometry, is a Python package intended to compute optical interferometry (OI) observables
from radiative transfer model images and compare them to observations from modern OI observatories (VLTI, CHARA, ...).

# Dependencies

DISTROI depends on a few other Python packages. The main dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file supplied with the source code. In addition,
the distroiEnv.yml file can be used to create a conda environment with all dependencies installed via 'conda env create -f distroiEnv.yml'.
