"""Subpackage for describing types of observational data.

Subpackage providing the implementation of the supported types of data (i.e. optical interferometry data, 
SEDs, etc.).

Notes
-----
Data can be either observed, or calculated from the model. In order to assure symmetry between these two
cases, the source code makes no differentiation between the two.
